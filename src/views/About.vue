    <h1 class="about-title">This App Tells You When To Water Plants</h1>
    <p>You know, for when the post-its on the pots get all soggy, and you want a cleaner way to manage things.</p>

    <p>The Plants page allows you to list, add, and remove all of your office plants.  Pretty self-explanatory.</p>

    <p>The Home page is your plant schedule.  If the day is today, you can tag your plants as watered, which will update the rest of the calendar to reflect when you actually water your plants.  Plants that are overdue will always show up on today's date.</p>
